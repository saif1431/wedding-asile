            These Terms of Use (the "Terms") describe the terms and conditions on which Shaadisouk ("Shaadisouk," "we," "us," or "our") makes its website available to Users (as defined below). These Terms apply to all websites and mobile applications owned and operated by us or our Affiliates (any entity that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control with, Shaadisouk) that link to these Terms, and to related online and offline services (including our social media pages), including but not limited to www.shaadisouk.com (the "Services").

            By accessing or using our website or any of our services (the "Services") at Shaadisouk ("Shaadisouk," "we," "us," or "our"), you confirm that you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use (the "Terms") and by our Privacy Notice, which are incorporated by reference.

          <p className="text-gray-800 ptext my-4">
            Certain features or products you use or purchase through the Services may be subject to additional terms presented to you at the time of use (in addition to these Terms). For example, if you are a Vendor (as defined below), your listing may be subject to separate Terms. If there is a conflict between these Terms and any additional terms, the latter shall take effect to the extent of the conflict.

          <p className="text-gray-800 ptext my-4">
            Although Vendors are vetted by Shaadisouk before being made live on our platform, we do not guarantee that every Vendor meets all legal or professional requirements. It is your responsibility to conduct any necessary due diligence when engaging a Vendor.

As a Member, you acknowledge that while we take steps to help verify the identity of Vendors when they register for our Services, we cannot guarantee each Vendor's identity, capabilities, that it has obtained all required permits or licenses, or that it complies with all applicable laws. While we make reasonable efforts to vet Vendors before they appear on our platform, we do not personally endorse or recommend any Vendor, nor do we guarantee the quality of their goods or services. Our Services are provided as a starting point for identifying wedding-related products and services; you should conduct your own research to ensure any Vendor you choose is appropriate, capable, and compliant with all relevant laws and standards.

            Our Services include a forum whereby Users can post a review of Vendors ("Review"). Reviews are an important way for Users to make informed decisions about Vendors and, as such, Shaadisouk takes steps to ensure that there is a transparent process for posting and, if necessary, removing Reviews in accordance with applicable laws.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-800 ptext my-4">
            If you have questions about these policies or procedures, or believe that a review violates these policies, please submit a request on contact us page.
          </p>

          <h5 className="text-black head-h5 my-4 text-xl font-bold">Publication Criteria</h5>
          <p className="text-gray-800 ptext my-4">
            Shaadisouk will publish all Reviews submitted by Users, provided that they meet the following conditions:
          </p>
          <ul className="my-4 list-decimal pl-8">
            <li className="text-gray-800 ptext">They are written by a User who used the Vendor for their own wedding or wedding-related event.</li>
            <li className="text-gray-800 ptext">They are written by a User who can attest to having contracted the Vendor's services.</li>
            <li className="text-gray-800 ptext">The Reviews are free of profanity or abusive language.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-gray-800 ptext my-4">
            Shaadisouk reserves the right to verify that the User who posts the Review meets the above criteria. Users who wish to post Reviews will be required to register with Shaadisouk, subject to these Terms and our Privacy Notice.
          </p>

          <h5 className="text-black head-h5 my-4 text-xl font-bold">Personal Data in Reviews</h5>
          <p className="text-gray-800 ptext my-4">
            Reviews may not contain the names or other personal data of staff members of the Vendor. If Reviews containing personal data of Vendor staff are reported to Shaadisouk, this information is redacted from the Review or, if redaction is not possible, the Review is removed.
          </p>

          <h5 className="text-black head-h5 my-4 text-xl font-bold">Complaints and Takedown Procedure</h5>
          <ul className="my-4 list-decimal pl-8">
            <li className="text-gray-800 ptext">User Removal Requests: A Review will be taken off the Shaadisouk website as soon as practicable where a User asks for their own Review to be removed.</li>
            <li className="text-gray-800 ptext">Vendor Removal Requests: Where a Vendor disputes or requests removal of a Review, removal will occur in the following cases:
              <br /><span>- The User who gave the opinion did not contract the services of the Vendor in question.</span>
              <br /><span>- There is a judicial decision ordering the deletion of the comment.</span>
              <br /><span>- The opinion is not about a wedding or wedding-related event.</span>
              <br /><span>- The same User gave the same opinion twice about the same Vendor.</span>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-gray-800 ptext my-4">
            If the Review does not fit one of the above cases, Shaadisouk will follow a takedown process (e.g., under the U.K. Defamation Act of 2013, if relevant). We will investigate the request pursuant to such process and notify the Vendor whether the Review will be removed.
          </p>

            Below is a revised Vendors section that incorporates the 15% commission and clarifies paid services, while emphasizing that Shaadisouk can make changes as needed.
          </p>

          <h5 className="text-black head-h5 my-4 text-xl font-bold">Vendors:</h5>
          <ul className="my-4 list-decimal pl-8">
            <li className="text-gray-800 ptext"><strong>Paid Services: </strong>Vendors may choose to purchase additional paid services (e.g., premium listings, advertising slots) to increase visibility on Shaadisouk. Such paid services are governed by separate terms, which detail the fees, payment schedules, and any additional obligations.</li>
            <li className="text-gray-800 ptext"><strong>15% Commission on Bookings: </strong>Shaadisouk charges Vendors a 15% commission on each successful booking made through our platform, where the customer is sourced by Shaadisouk and the transaction is completed via the platform. This commission is deducted before payout is issued to the Vendor. This commission is intended to align with Vendor success, ensuring fees apply only when confirmed bookings occur.</li>
            <li className="text-gray-800 ptext"><strong>Changes and Revisions: </strong>We reserve the right to add or revise our services, including any fees or commissions, at our discretion. This may also involve changes to how listings appear or how Vendors are billed for various features. We will provide notice of such updates as required by law or via our usual communication channels, and continued use of our Services after these changes implies acceptance of the revised terms.</li>
          </ul>

          <h5 className="text-black head-h5 my-4 text-xl font-bold">Additional Booking & Payment Terms:</h5>
          <p className="text-gray-800 ptext"><strong>29-Day Rule:</strong></p>
          <ul className="my-4 list-decimal pl-8">
            <li className="text-gray-800 ptext">If the event date is 29 days or less from the booking date, the full price of the service is due at the time of booking (i.e., no deposit stage; the entire amount is paid upfront).</li>
            <li className="text-gray-800 ptext">If a Vendor is available and the couple books the service 2 days prior (or less) to the event, payment in full (with no deposit) still applies under the 29-day rule.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-gray-800 ptext"><strong>Late Payment Penalty:</strong></p>
          <ul className="my-4 list-decimal pl-8">
            <li className="text-gray-800 ptext">If a Member (customer) misses a scheduled payment (e.g., fails to pay the deposit or final installment by the due date), a late penalty of 1% of the total booking amount per day will be added to the outstanding balance.</li>
            <li className="text-gray-800 ptext">This penalty accumulates daily until the overdue amount is fully paid.</li>
          </ul>
