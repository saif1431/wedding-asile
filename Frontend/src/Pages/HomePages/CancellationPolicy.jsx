<p className='font-philper'>Cancellation by Your Supplier – Our Cancellation Guarantee
</p>
<p>In the unlikely event that Your Supplier cancels Your booking, You will be offered the choice of a refund, or a replacement Supplier in accordance with this paragraph. Where We are able to do so, and provided we have at least 48 hours’ notice from Your Supplier, ShaadiSouk will offer You with an alternative Supplier of similar quality (“Replacement Supplier”) at Our discretion who is available on Your Event Date. Where a Replacement Supplier’s fees are more than the fees charged by Your Supplier, You will not be required to pay any additional fees. Where a Replacement Supplier’s fees are less than the fees charged by Your Supplier, You shall receive a refund of the difference. If Your Supplier cancels and We are unable to offer You a Replacement Supplier (provided We have at least 48 hours to find one), You will receive a full refund from Your Supplier. Where You accept a Replacement Supplier, You will have a direct contract with that Replacement Supplier, and should discuss any specific requirements with that Replacement Supplier. Our role will remain that of an intermediary introducer, even in the event we offer You a Replacement Supplier.

</p>
<p className='font-philper'>Cancellations Due to Events Beyond a Party’s Reasonable Control
</p>
<p>A booking may be cancelled due to an event which is beyond the reasonable control of Your Supplier, for example: extreme weather conditions, government actions, war, terrorism, riots, strikes, epidemics or pandemics, and acts of God. Where this happens, the cancellation policy above no longer applies and You will not be entitled to any refund and the cancellation terms above shall not apply. Neither You nor Us shall be in breach of this agreement nor liable for failure to deliver services or for a delay in the provision of services if and to the extent that such delay or non-delivery is due to such an event. That said, where Your Supplier is unable to attend Your wedding due to their ill-health, or an event beyond their reasonable control, ShaadiSouk will use Our commercially reasonable endeavours to find You a replacement Supplier of comparable quality, where there is sufficient time to do so
